          At Ecobin, we turn plastic waste into community rewards.
          We partner with residential societies, enabling officials to approve members, track waste collection, and manage rewards.
          Families participate by collecting recyclable plastic, earning points for their society with every kilogram gathered. <br></br>
          <br></br>
          These points fund eco-projects, community events, or facility upgrades — making waste management transparent, rewarding, and impactful.
          Together, we build cleaner neighborhoods, reduce pollution, and create a greener future.
