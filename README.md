<h2>🌱 About EcoBin</h2>

<p>
Water, air, and environment are essential for a healthy life, but waste mismanagement
has become a major issue in modern societies. Large amounts of recyclable dry waste
often go unused or are disposed of improperly.
</p>

<p>
<b>EcoBin</b> is a web-based platform designed to collect dry recyclable waste from housing
societies and sell it to authorized recycling companies. Instead of direct cash returns,
societies receive useful and essential items in return, promoting both sustainability
and community benefit.
</p>

<p>
This platform was built using the <b>MERN stack</b> and is intended for teams or organizations
who want to run structured, scalable, and impact-driven waste management operations.

<h2>⚙️ How EcoBin Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Housing societies register and list their dry recyclable waste.
  </li>
  <li>
    The EcoBin team collects the waste from societies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Collected waste is sold to authorized recycling companies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Revenue generated from recycling is converted into useful items.
  </li>
  <li>
    These items are offered back to societies as a return benefit.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
This approach ensures transparency, sustainability, and real value creation
without encouraging direct cash handling.
