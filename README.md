<h2>🌱 About EcoBin</h2>

<p>
Blue waste, especially plastic and dry recyclable waste, has become one of the
biggest threats to the environment. Such waste takes <b>hundreds of years</b>
to decompose and often ends up polluting land, water bodies, and harming wildlife.
Improper disposal of blue waste contributes significantly to environmental degradation.
</p>

<p>
Despite being recyclable, a large portion of blue waste generated by housing societies
is either mixed with other waste or ignored due to lack of proper collection systems.
This leads to missed recycling opportunities and long-term environmental damage.
</p>

<p>
<b>EcoBin</b> was developed as a solution to this problem. The platform focuses on
collecting dry recyclable waste from societies and responsibly channeling it to
authorized recycling companies. Instead of direct monetary returns, societies receive
useful and essential items, encouraging sustainable and value-driven waste management.
</p>

<p>
This project was built as a <b>college project</b> with the goal of solving a real-world
problem while gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development using the
<b>MERN stack</b>. It is designed for teams who want to run organized, community-based
waste management initiatives.

<h2>⚙️ How EcoBin Works</h2>

<p>
EcoBin is designed as a structured platform where <b>housing societies</b> and
<b>recycling companies</b> work together under the supervision of the EcoBin team
to ensure transparent and impactful blue waste management.
</p>

<h3>1) Registration & Approval</h3>
<p>
Housing societies and recycling companies can register on the EcoBin platform.
All registrations are reviewed and approved by the EcoBin site team to ensure
authenticity and responsible participation.
</p>

<h3>2) Society & Family Management</h3>
<p>
Once approved, society officials can add individual families to their society profile.
All registered families can view collective society waste statistics, progress,
and environmental contribution through the platform.
</p>

<h3>3) Waste Tracking</h3>
<p>
Daily blue waste generated by societies is tracked using sensors and recorded in the system.
This helps maintain accurate data, transparency, and consistent monitoring of waste contribution.
</p>

<h3>4) Waste Collection Process</h3>
<p>
When a society is ready to hand over collected waste, they can place a waste collection request.
Upon receiving the request, the EcoBin site team assigns a unit to collect the waste from the society.
</p>

<h3>5) EcoPoints, Badges & Rankings</h3>
<p>
Waste contribution is not measured in kilograms directly but converted into <b>EcoPoints</b>.
For every <b>1 kg of waste</b>, the society earns <b>2 EcoPoints</b>.
</p>

<p>
Based on the total EcoPoints earned, societies receive badges and are ranked on the platform.
Societies with higher contributions gain higher rankings, motivating healthy competition.
</p>

<p>
The <b>top 100 societies</b> on the leaderboard receive additional benefits and recognition
for their environmental efforts.
</p>

<h3>6) Reward System</h3>
<p>
After achieving a specific EcoPoints milestone, societies are allowed to vote for products
through the platform. The product with the highest votes is provided to the society as a reward,
benefiting all registered families.
</p>

<h3>7) Environmental Missions</h3>
<p>
EcoBin also organizes special environmental missions such as cleanliness drives,
awareness programs, and sustainability campaigns. Societies participating in these
missions receive additional EcoPoints as a reward for active involvement.
</p>

<p>
This complete workflow ensures long-term engagement, transparency, and motivation,
transforming waste management into a collaborative and rewarding environmental initiative.
