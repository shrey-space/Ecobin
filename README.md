<h2>🌱 About EcoBin</h2>

<p>
Blue waste, especially plastic and dry recyclable waste, has become one of the
biggest threats to the environment. Such waste takes <b>hundreds of years</b>
to decompose and often ends up polluting land, water bodies, and harming wildlife.
Improper disposal of blue waste contributes significantly to environmental degradation.
</p>

<p>
Despite being recyclable, a large portion of blue waste generated by housing societies
is either mixed with other waste or ignored due to lack of proper collection systems.
This leads to missed recycling opportunities and long-term environmental damage.
</p>

<p>
<b>EcoBin</b> was developed as a solution to this problem. The platform focuses on
collecting dry recyclable waste from societies and responsibly channeling it to
authorized recycling companies. Instead of direct monetary returns, societies receive
useful and essential items, encouraging sustainable and value-driven waste management.
</p>

<p>
This project was built as a <b>college project</b> with the goal of solving a real-world
problem while gaining hands-on experience in full-stack development using the
<b>MERN stack</b>. It is designed for teams who want to run organized, community-based
waste management initiatives.

<h2>⚙️ How EcoBin Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Housing societies register and list their dry recyclable waste.
  </li>
  <li>
    The EcoBin team collects the waste from societies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Collected waste is sold to authorized recycling companies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Revenue generated from recycling is converted into useful items.
  </li>
  <li>
    These items are offered back to societies as a return benefit.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
This approach ensures transparency, sustainability, and real value creation
without encouraging direct cash handling.
